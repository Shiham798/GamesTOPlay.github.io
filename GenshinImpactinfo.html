<p align="center"><font Size="20" color="white"><b>Game Discription</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5" color="white">Genshin Impact is an open world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four 
interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly and during combat 
to the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks.[11] Characters may have their 
strengths enhanced in various ways, such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the 
weapons that the character equips.[12] In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges 
for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are highly powerful challenges that reward highly valuable resources, but 
claiming them uses up a currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time.[13] Completing these challenges 
grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and 
raises the World Level.[14] The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of 
rewards that defeating them gives.[15]
The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding which are 
limited by stamina.[16][11] Some characters possess abilities that can alter the environment, such as freezing water to 
create a path that can aid the player in traversing terrain.[11] Many teleportation nodes exist throughout the world that
 players can warp to, and statues known as the Statues of The Seven can heal and revive characters and provide benefits 
 such as increasing player stamina.[17] Items such as food and ore may be procured from the open world, while enemies and 
 treasure chests drop other types of resources that may be used in enhancing a character's strength. Players can obtain 
 food from hunting animals, gathering wild fruit and vegetables, or purchasing them from a store. Most ingredients can
 be cooked into a dish. Some meals regenerate characters' health, while others boost various statistics.[18] Mining can
 be done by attacking and destroying mining nodes to produce ore.[19] Ore can be refined and then used to enhance weapon 
 strength or create weapons.[20]
Each character has two unique combat skills: an elemental skill and an elemental burst. The elemental skill can be used 
at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use.[21] In contrast, the elemental burst has an energy cost,
 requiring the user to amass sufficient elemental energy by defeating enemies or inflicting elemental status effects.[22]
 [23] Characters have control over one of seven natural elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro and Geo, which 
 correspond to ice, nature, fire, water, air, electricity, and earth respectively.[24] These elements can interact in 
 different ways; for example, if a Hydro attack hits a target, the enemy will be inflicted with the "Wet" status effect,
 and if they are hit with a Cryo attack, it will inflict "Cold".[24] These two status effects combine into the "Frozen" 
 status effect, temporarily preventing the target from performing any actions or until the player deals enough physical 
 damage to the enemy.[24] Switching between characters during combat and executing those skills allows those elemental 
 interactions to take place.[25] Certain elemental abilities may be required to solve puzzles within the overworld.[11]
A multiplayer mode is available in the form of co-op. Up to 4 players can play together in the overworld and join domains.
[7] Player matching can either be done by requesting to connect with another player.[7] If the player wishes to clear a domain 
with other players, they will be automatically matched up with others looking to tackle the same objective.[26] The game features
 cross-platform play, so players on any platform can play with each other.[27]
By completing quests to advance the story, the player can unlock three additional playable characters,[28] and more characters 
can be obtained via a gacha mechanic.[29] Several premium in-game currencies, obtainable through in-app purchases and playing the 
game, can be used to obtain characters and weapons through the gacha system.[30]</p>
